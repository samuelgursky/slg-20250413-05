# Timeline Component Function Tests

## Test Environment
- DaVinci Resolve version: 18.6
- Test project: Untitled Project 2025-04-13_210753
- Timeline: Duplicated_Timeline

## Test Results

### 1. get_current_video_item

**Function Purpose**: Gets the video item currently at the playhead position (workaround for timeline item selection)

**Test Setup**:
- Created a timeline with a text title
- Set playhead position to 01:00:00:00
- Called function with no parameters

**Test Results**:
- Status: ❌ Failed
- Error: "Error getting current video item details: 'NoneType' object is not callable"
- Notes: Function implementation may need debugging as it fails even with clips in the timeline.

### 2. get_current_clip_thumbnail_image

**Function Purpose**: Gets a thumbnail image of the current clip at the playhead position

**Test Setup**:
- Created a timeline with a text title
- Set playhead position to 01:00:00:00
- Called function with no parameters

**Test Results**:
- Status: ❌ Failed
- Error: "Failed to get thumbnail for the current clip"
- Notes: Function returns a nested error result - appears to be implemented but unable to retrieve the thumbnail.

### 3. set_start_timecode

**Function Purpose**: Sets the start timecode of the current timeline

**Test Setup**:
- Active timeline with a text title
- Called function with parameter `timecode: "01:30:00:00"`

**Test Results**:
- Status: ✅ Success
- Result: Successfully changed the start timecode to 01:30:00:00
- Verified: Timeline details show the updated timecode (01:30:05:00 with correct offset)
- Notes: Function worked as expected, properly updating the timeline start timecode.

### 4. set_clips_linked

**Function Purpose**: Sets clips to be linked or unlinked

**Test Setup**:
- Active timeline with multiple text titles
- Called function with parameters `clip_ids: ["1", "2"]` and `linked: true`

**Test Results**:
- Status: ❌ Failed (with dependency issue)
- Error: "Could not find any of the specified timeline items"
- Notes: The function implementation appears to be correct, but has a dependency on getting valid timeline item IDs. Both `set_clips_linked` and `get_timeline_items` need further debugging as the timeline items are not being properly identified/retrieved.

### 5. create_fusion_clip

**Function Purpose**: Creates a Fusion clip from specified timeline items

**Test Setup**:
- Active timeline with multiple text titles
- Called function with parameter `timeline_items: ["1", "2"]`

**Test Results**:
- Status: ❌ Failed (with dependency issue)
- Error: "Could not find any of the specified timeline items"
- Notes: Similar to `set_clips_linked`, this function depends on valid timeline item IDs. It shares the same issue with timeline item identification/retrieval as other functions.

### 6. import_into_timeline

**Function Purpose**: Imports media or AAF/XML/EDL/etc. into the current timeline

**Test Setup**:
- Active timeline
- Created a test file at `/Users/samuelgursky/davinci-resolve-mcp-20250413-05/test_results/test_import.txt`
- Called function with parameter `file_path: "/Users/samuelgursky/davinci-resolve-mcp-20250413-05/test_results/test_import.txt"`

**Test Results**:
- Status: ❌ Failed
- Error: "Failed to import /Users/samuelgursky/davinci-resolve-mcp-20250413-05/test_results/test_import.txt into timeline"
- Notes: The function correctly validates file existence but fails when trying to import. The test file format (.txt) is likely not supported by DaVinci Resolve for timeline import. The function implementation should provide more detailed error messages about supported formats.

### 7. grab_all_stills

**Function Purpose**: Grabs stills from all clips in the timeline at the specified source frame

**Test Setup**:
- Active timeline with multiple text titles
- Called function with parameter `still_frame_source: 1` (first frame)

**Test Results**:
- Status: ✅ Success
- Result: `{"success": true, "stills_count": 2, "message": "Successfully grabbed 2 stills from timeline"}`
- Notes: Function successfully grabbed stills from the timeline items, even though other functions had issues identifying those items.

## Summary

| Function | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| set_start_timecode | ✅ Success | Works as expected |
| grab_all_stills | ✅ Success | Works as expected |
| get_current_video_item | ❌ Failed | Issues with NoneType error |
| get_current_clip_thumbnail_image | ❌ Failed | Cannot get thumbnail |
| set_clips_linked | ❌ Failed | Issues finding timeline items |
| create_fusion_clip | ❌ Failed | Issues finding timeline items |
| import_into_timeline | ❌ Failed | Format validation issues |

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Timeline Item Identification**: Several functions that depend on timeline item IDs fail because the items cannot be properly identified or retrieved. This affects `set_clips_linked` and `create_fusion_clip`.

2. **Current Item Retrieval**: Functions that try to get the current item at the playhead position fail with various errors. This affects `get_current_video_item` and `get_current_clip_thumbnail_image`.

3. **Format Validation**: The `import_into_timeline` function needs better validation and error messaging for supported file formats.

4. **Inconsistent Behavior**: Interestingly, `grab_all_stills` works correctly even though other functions fail to identify timeline items, suggesting possible implementation inconsistencies in how timeline items are accessed.

## Next Steps

Functions that need debugging:
1. `get_current_video_item` - Current implementation has issues with 'NoneType' error
2. `get_current_clip_thumbnail_image` - Fails to get thumbnail
3. `set_clips_linked` - Cannot find timeline items, possibly related to issues with `get_timeline_items`
4. `get_timeline_items` - Doesn't return items when they are added to the timeline
5. `create_fusion_clip` - Cannot find timeline items, has the same dependency issue
6. `import_into_timeline` - Needs better format validation and error messages

Functions still to test:
1. `grab_all_stills`
