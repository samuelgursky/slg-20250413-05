# DaVinci Resolve MCP Development Rules

# API implementation workflow rules
- When implementing a new API function, update API_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKING.md with status
- All component functions should use the safe_api_call pattern for consistent error handling
- Functions with dependencies should have appropriate error messages when dependencies fail

# Code organization
- All component code goes in src/components/{component_name}
- Tool registrations go in src/tools/registration.py
- Common utilities go in src/resolve_api.py

# Testing workflow
- Update the API_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKING.md with test results
- Mark functions as working only after actual testing
- Note particular issues with functions in the notes column
- Update overall implementation percentages when adding new functions

# PR requirements
- Include updates to API_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKING.md
- Ensure all new functions are registered in the tools registry
- Include test results for newly implemented functions
- Update the High Priority Functions section based on recent implementations
